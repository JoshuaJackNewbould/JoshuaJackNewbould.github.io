Review from Group 3:
Few changes made last second, but frequent commits to repo.
HTML is valid.
Land slide is interesting.
Average written presentation, inconsistent capitalized titles.
Kaiyue missing LinkedIn.
Consistent visual representation.
Bio was done correctly by others.
Balanced contribution to development, judging only from the frequency of commits.
