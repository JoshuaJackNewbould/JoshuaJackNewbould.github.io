    <h1>Very Brief Evaluation To The Impact Of Internet On Students</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>More and more students here are starting using the Internet, through which they can get a great deal of the latest information. They can enjoy lessons given by the best teachers of net-schools at home. And it is easy and convenient to keep in touch with friends by sending and receiving e-mails.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, some students have spent too much time chatting on the net. And there is still something harmful to the students.For example，baicomputer games are popular among young students.This makes them lose control of themselves.They spend most of their time playing computer games instead of studying,which causes their grades to drop sharply.</li>
        <li>In my opinion,I suggest that students should be good at using the Internet for their studies, but not for purely entertainment. It is essential to find a work-life balance for Internet users who are still in school.</li>
