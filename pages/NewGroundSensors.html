            Small towns in india have a frequent and very dangerous problem: landslides. Caused by flooding, ground movement and more, avoiding these unpredictable disasters can be near impossible without the right equipment. Image of landslide damage. Credit: BBC</a> Throughout the year landslides destroy villages and towns throughout the country (especially ones close to the himalayas), displacing millions and killing thousands. Unfortunately, the only way for them to combat these issues are either luck or expensive sensors many cannot afford especially in these rural towns. However, a new sensor has come to market. Costing only 20,000 rupees (approximately 200 pounds) these sensors cost a fraction of the price of previous sensors available to the market. This sharp reduction in cost can have amazing affects as more and more villages and towns can afford to monitorthe nearby enviroment possibly saving thousands of lives.

            How do they work? <br>
            <!--Lots of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors-->
            The sensors is almost the same as the accelerometer in your smartphone (just with a few changes). accelerometers measure acceleration and can therefore detect momvement. by placing it in the soil we can detect if the soil is moving and if it moves outside of a certain degree of safety we can sound ealry warning alarms for landslides. the hope is that we can use the large amount of data collected by the sensors along with machine learning algorithms tto predict landslides anywhere from 24hours to a week in advance. this early of a warniong can save thousands of lives and helo the goverment prepare for the thousands of displaced citizens when the landslides inevitasbly occur.
